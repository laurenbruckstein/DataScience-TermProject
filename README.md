# DataScience-TermProject

### Goal
The goal of this project is to expose you with a real data science problem, looking at the end-to-end pipeline.

### What to do
You are asked to modify a Python Jupyter notebook, called `bikes_pgh_data.ipynb` that will:
* [Task 1] access historical bike rental data for 2019 from HealthyRidePGH and summarize the rental data  
* [Task 2] create graphs to show the popularity of the different rental stations, given filter conditions  
* [Task 3] create graphs to show the rebalancing issue  
* [Task 4] cluster the data to group similar stations together, using a variety of clustering functions and visualize the results of the clustering.
